## 🛠️ **Tools and Usage**

### **Enhanced Code Standards System:**
```python
from team_packages.team_d_organization.enhanced_code_standards import CTASCodeStandards

# Initialize enhanced system
standards = CTASCodeStandards()

# Run comprehensive analysis
analysis = standards.analyze_repository()

# Generate detailed report
report = standards.generate_detailed_report(analysis)

# Save analysis for tracking
standards.save_analysis(analysis, "ctas_standards_analysis.json")
```

### **Team Execution Integration:**
```python
# In run_all_teams.py - automatically runs during team execution
standards = CTASCodeStandards()
analysis = standards.analyze_repository()
logger.info(f"Code standards: {analysis.summary['compliance_rate']:.1f}% compliant ({analysis.compliance_level.value})")
