# NyxTrace 6.6 Complete Refactoring Plan

Based on the handoff documentation and team structure analysis, here's the comprehensive refactoring plan:

## Team Structure Implementation

The system references three main operational teams:
- **SOC Team A**: Primary cyber threat detection and initial response
- **SOC Team B**: Data exfiltration and advanced persistent threat analysis  
- **SOC Team C**: Social engineering and human-factor threat analysis
- **Security Team A**: Physical security and access control
- **Security Team B**: Facility security and badge management
- **Security Team C**: Physical breach investigation and response

## Phase 1: Database Layer Refactoring (IMMEDIATE PRIORITY)

### Thread-Safety Issues
- [ ] Fix Streamlit threading issues in database connections
- [ ] Implement proper connection pooling for Supabase, MongoDB, Neo4j
- [ ] Add connection timeout and retry mechanisms
- [ ] Create connection status monitoring dashboard

### Database Connector Standardization
- [ ] Refactor `database/supabase/thread_safe_connector.py`
- [ ] Standardize `database/mongodb/connector.py` 
- [ ] Unify `database/neo4j/connector.py` interface
- [ ] Create unified database factory pattern

## Phase 2: HTML Rendering Fixes (HIGH PRIORITY)

### Task Viewer Component Issues
- [ ] Fix raw HTML display in `pages/adversary_task_viewer.py`
- [ ] Replace custom HTML with native Streamlit components
- [ ] Fix CSS loading compatibility with Replit environment
- [ ] Implement robust error handling for rendering failures

### Component Isolation
- [ ] Isolate UI components in `pages/` directory
- [ ] Create component testing framework
- [ ] Document component interfaces for React migration

## Phase 3: Code Standardization (ONGOING)

### CTAS Standards Enforcement
- [ ] Apply 80-character line length across all 175 Python files
- [ ] Limit module size to 300 lines maximum (not 30 as originally specified)
- [ ] Increase comment density to 15% minimum
- [ ] Add comprehensive docstrings to all functions

### File Structure Issues
- [ ] Large files needing splitting:
  - `main.py` (30,277 lines) - CRITICAL
  - `core/integrations/satellite/google_earth_integration.py` (~1800+ lines)
  - `core/integrations/graph_db/neo4j_connector.py` (~1200+ lines)

## Phase 4: Team-Specific Module Implementation

### SOC Team A Module (`core/soc_teams/team_a/`)
- [ ] Cyber intrusion detection algorithms
- [ ] Authentication failure analysis
- [ ] Privilege escalation monitoring
- [ ] Suspicious network traffic analysis

### SOC Team B Module (`core/soc_teams/team_b/`)
- [ ] Data exfiltration detection
- [ ] Large outbound transfer monitoring
- [ ] Research database protection
- [ ] Advanced persistent threat analysis

### SOC Team C Module (`core/soc_teams/team_c/`)
- [ ] Social engineering detection
- [ ] Help desk security protocols
- [ ] Human factor analysis
- [ ] Communication pattern analysis

### Security Teams Module (`core/security_teams/`)
- [ ] Physical security breach detection
- [ ] Unauthorized access monitoring
- [ ] Badge reader analysis
- [ ] Facility access control

## Phase 5: Data Type Consistency

### Element Object Standardization
- [ ] Resolve Element objects vs. dictionaries inconsistency
- [ ] Implement proper type checking and validation
- [ ] Create consistent serialization/deserialization methods
- [ ] Standardize QueryResult objects

## Phase 6: Performance Optimization

### Large Dataset Handling
- [ ] Implement lazy loading for large datasets
- [ ] Add pagination for task lists and data tables
- [ ] Create data caching mechanisms
- [ ] Optimize initial load time

### Database Query Optimization
- [ ] Optimize database queries
- [ ] Implement proper indexing
- [ ] Add query caching where appropriate
- [ ] Create database performance metrics

## Implementation Priority Order

1. **CRITICAL**: Split `main.py` into modular components
2. **HIGH**: Fix database threading issues
3. **HIGH**: Fix HTML rendering in task viewer
4. **MEDIUM**: Implement team-specific modules
5. **MEDIUM**: Standardize code formatting and documentation
6. **LOW**: Performance optimizations

## Success Metrics

- [ ] All files under 300 lines
- [ ] 15% comment density achieved
- [ ] No threading issues in database layer
- [ ] HTML rendering works in all environments
- [ ] Team-specific functionality properly modularized
- [ ] Performance improvements measurable

## Next Steps

1. Start with main.py refactoring
2. Implement database connection fixes
3. Create team-specific module structure
4. Apply code standards systematically
5. Test all components thoroughly
