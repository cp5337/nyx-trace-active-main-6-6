# NyxTrace Project Handoff Instructions

## Preparing the Complete Handoff Package

To create a comprehensive handoff package for the AI developer, please complete these remaining steps:

### 1. Capture Essential UI Screenshots

Capture screenshots of all key interfaces following the organization in SCREENSHOT_CAPTURE_GUIDE.md. Place these screenshots in the ui_screenshots folder with descriptive filenames:

```
handoff_package/ui_screenshots/01_main_dashboard.png
handoff_package/ui_screenshots/02_adversary_task_viewer.png
handoff_package/ui_screenshots/03_periodic_table.png
...etc
```

### 2. Verify ZIP Archive Contents

Ensure the numbered ZIP archives contain the most up-to-date code with all necessary dependencies:

- 01_nyxtrace_database.zip
- 02_nyxtrace_core.zip
- 03_nyxtrace_utils.zip
- 04_nyxtrace_docs.zip
- 05_nyxtrace_streamlit_frontend.zip
- 06_nyxtrace_streamlit_pages.zip

### 3. Add Component-Specific README Files

For each component ZIP, consider adding a component-specific README file based on the README_TEMPLATE.md provided in this package.

### 4. Create Final Handoff Archive

Once all materials are collected, create a final archive of the entire handoff_package folder:

```
zip -r nyxtrace_handoff_package.zip handoff_package/
```

This will produce a single file containing all documentation, code archives, and UI references needed by the AI developer.

## Key Points for the AI Developer

Make sure to communicate these important aspects to the AI developer:

1. **Thread-Safety Requirements**: Database operations must use thread-safe connectors due to Streamlit's threading model.

2. **HTML Rendering in Replit**: Task cards rendering has been problematic in Replit - special attention needed here.

3. **React Migration Considerations**: If migrating to React, refer to the REACT_MIGRATION_GUIDE.md for component mapping.

4. **Database Configuration**: Proper Supabase credentials must be configured before testing.

5. **Performance Considerations**: Task viewer should limit display to 50 tasks maximum for performance.

The documentation provided in this package should give the AI developer a comprehensive understanding of the project structure, current issues, and refactoring priorities.
